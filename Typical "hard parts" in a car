n pedestrian safety simulations for Euro NCAP (specifically for Pedestrian Protection), the term "hard parts" refers to rigid or less deformable components beneath the vehicle's exterior surface that pose a higher injury risk to pedestrians upon impact.

When defining target points (like headform impact points), identifying hard parts is essential because impacts in these areas typically receive lower safety scores due to the greater potential for injury.

ðŸ”§ Typical "hard parts" in a car (relevant to pedestrian simulations):
1. Under the Hood (Bonnet)
Engine block

Battery

Brake master cylinder

Shock towers / suspension strut mounts

Inverter (for EVs)

Radiator fans (if mounted high)

Bonnet latch system

HV components (in electric vehicles)

2. Cowl Area / Lower Windshield Edge
Wiper motor and linkage

HVAC unit

Firewall (bulkhead)

3. Fenders (Wheel Arches)
Strut tops / mounts

Suspension components close to upper edge

4. Front Bumper Area
Crash box or front longitudinal members (if too close to bumper skin)

Tow hooks

Reinforcement beams

Radar or sensor modules (if rigidly mounted)

5. A-pillars and Roof Edge
These are inherently hard structures and are excluded from headform testing, but may still be included in legform impact evaluations in some setups.
